<u>Foreword</u></br>
<p1>I have lived all my life (all eighteen years) around small villages, and it is in them that my happiest memories are. I spent the first 6 or 7 years of my life in the small town of Midhurst in West Sussex; it is there, in the gently rolling South Downs which my “home” is, though we have lived away from them for quite some time now. Much of my time was spent in the small hamlet of Heyshott, just down the road, where my parents lived for some time. It is a tiny settlement of around 270 people, with a small ancient church and a single pub, <i>The Unicorn</i>; my Great-Grandmother kept the watermill in the village, though it was fairly comprehensively ruined when she died and it was sold. I have always found it rather sad: the orchard, ancient hedgerows and woodland that she had saved and carefully tended to were uprooted, and a rather horrid new house was built over it all, including where her dogs were buried. I was not to be born for a little while at that point, and at any rate I couldn’t have stopped it. But paired with my love and fascination with the past, I became determined to prevent that sort of thing happening again.</p1>
</br></br>
In this document (essay? manifesto? letter? I’m not quite sure what to call it) I am simply trying to put some of my ideas to paper and lament the changing of the world. I shall try to be brief, but I am well known to be rather loquacious! I am ever hopeful that I can be a force of good in the world and preserve its natural, built and cultural beauty.
</br></br>
<u>The English Village</u></br>
If you were to walk into any small English village, you would see somewhere very different to a hundred years ago, or even forty or fifty. The English idyll is that of “Merrie England”, a pseudo-utopian society of pastoral bliss. It never really existed, but I believe we were once far closer to it than we ever will be again. This almost nostalgic view I hold was formed through listening to my grandad’s (and Great-Uncles’) tales of their childhood in the 1940s.
</br></br>

</br></br>
Here is a plan I sketched of the typical small village around 100 years ago, to illustrate the points I am going to make below.
</br></br>
Underlying everything in that age was a deep faith in God, expressed in the ancient churches of the countryside that almost seem to have grown from the landscape itself; as Pevsner put it of a dear little church I know in West Sussex: “a visible loving testimony of the faith of successive generations. It is incredibly moving.” As much as I love the grandeur of our cathedrals, there is something special about a tiny ancient parish church. Again, Pevsner put it best: “The atmosphere as tangible as any moulding, the slow, loving, gentle accretion century by century until it is something as organic as the South Downs around it.” The small church was at the centre of the village community, being the focal point for the highs and lows of life and village celebrations. Everyone attended; it was a weekly gathering of the whole community.
</br></br>
An important figure in the life of the village was the parish priest in the age when every tiny village had its own vicar. We still have a fanciful idea of the vicar cycling through the village to the service. When the village met, the vicar would be the one to lead the community, whatever the event might be. He would be well educated aand interesting, and in a small parish might find the time to write a book, paint or run the County Archæological Society.
</br></br>
At the centre of our small village lies the “Big House”. It may not actually be particularly large - perhaps of a similar size to the Vicarage - but is an important part of village life. It is the home of the local landowner; he has probably inherited the house, or made money in the emerging industrial world and bought it. He will probably own the whole village (except for the church), and perhaps more besides, including swathes of fields and parkland. It was an era of benevolence, or at least the appearance of benevolence, and as such will look out for the wellbeing of the village. In this agrian era, the Squire’s wealth depended on the income from the farms and tenants of the village, and so even the most selfish landowner had to keep the villagers happy and the buildings maintained. Probably he or his ancestors will have donated a school, village hall or reading room to the village at some point as a sign of good will. From the study of the house, the affairs of the village will be managed, and improved where it is needed. It was common for the Squire to have built almshouses to support the villagers in retirement. He would attend the village church and know his tenants well. He would be, as Mark Girouard describes it in <i>The Victorian Country House</i>,
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Faithful to God, reverent to women, courteous in his language, modest in his demeanour, lacking in arrogance, and a shield and support to his tenantry.”</p>
In every rural village, but particularly small ones, farms and the people who worked them made up the majority of the working population and were vital to the community. The parish would have a number of larger farms, but every cottage would grow their own vegetables, keep chickens and probably a pig as well. The people of the village would know one another well, and know who could supply what: at this time, every small village was near self-sustaining. Butchers, bakers, dairymen and the like would work from their own front room on a small scale for the rest of the village and perhaps neighbouring ones. Every village would have at least one smithy to serve it. Every member of the village community had their place in a self-sustaining community. During my research into the history of my great-uncle’s farm in Somerset, Waterhayes, I came across a rather lovely set of recollections by a man in their small village, which is a wonderfully atmospheric read and describes aspects of what I have just described (it is called The Book of Buckland and was written in 1913; sadly it seems to no longer be available online).
</br></br>
Central to every small village is the local pub. There was a pub boom in late Victorian times, and so it may have had multiple. The pub is the great leveller; a focal point for village activities and community. Most small pubs would have brewed their own beer, and likely cider in the west country. Likewise the village hall would be the host of events throughout one’s life; wedding parties, wakes and birthdays. The hall would be built by the people of the village or a gift to them, likely from the “Big House”, and would be cherished. It may well be a church hall, built for the social side of churchgoing. It is probable that there is a small Post Office and village shop operated out of a family’s front room; almost every tiny village once had one.
</br></br>
As we return to the centre of the village, there will likely be a village green and a cricket pitch next to the church. Originally a piece of common land, or perhaps donated by the local lord, it forms the centre of village celebrations. It is here that bonfires are lit, songs sung and feasts eaten. In the summer, it plays host to friendly cricket matches with the neighbouring village, with cream teas in the shade of the trees.
</br></br>
Somewhere there will be a small school - probably of only a single classroom - for the children of the village. The school is at the centre of the community, with the children leading the traditional celebrations: dancing the maypole, making Guy Fawkes for the bonfire, and putting on an annual play. These ancient celebrations bring the whole village together as one.
</br></br>
As a whole, the small village is the host to entire lifetimes; the calendar is in tune with nature, dutiful to God, and brings the village together regularly. The villagers support one another, the happiness and prosperity of the village managed from the estate office. Architecturally, a thousand years of history blend seamlessly together, each generation building in the vernacular on the work of the previous; the village seems almost part of the landscape, having stood for so long. Everything is productive; orchards intertwine with rose gardens and vegetable patches. The cottages rise and fall with the landscape, huddled in this small corner of the rolling hills.
</br></br>
But in the last hundred years, much has changed. It pains me to see the tiny villages I know and love and imagine them in this heyday. In such a small place, the parish church will have just about limped into the present day, surviving as part of an enormous benefice and perhaps only having a service once a month. The membership will be dwindling, as young people are priced out of their own villages, the idyllic little cottages snapped up by absentee londoners. There will probably be only a single churchwarden, who has held the job for the last thirty years, and there will certainly be no choir. Quite likely there will not even be an organist, and the congregation will have resorted to “tinned music”. They will be lucky to still have bellringers. The local vicar will be shared with many other similar small villages.
</br></br>
The vicarage in the village will now be long sold off. It is highly unlikely that our typical small village will have a resident vicar, as he will live elsewhere in the benefice.
</br></br>
The “Big House” may well have been demolished as the dwindling fortunes of agriculture bit the family who owned it. If it has survived it will probably be a care home or events “venue” of some kind. If it remains a home it will likely be a foreign owner or wealthy outsider who doesn’t care about the community it once supported. Even if they do care, the attached estate will have been split and sold off, leaving the occupant with little opportunity to help the community. Most often it will have an owner who isolates it, shutting off public access to the grounds and no longer hosting fetes and other village events, which will probably have died with it.
</br></br>
Elsewhere in the village, the pub will probably have struggled through, surviving to the present day. If there were multiple pubs once, all but one will have closed. It will be trying to reinvent itself as a “gastropub” or something of that sort, but it will struggle to find a new publican once this one retires. Sadly many have abandoned their historic names in a desperate attempt to appear “modern”.
</br></br>
There will probably be a patch of grass, where May Day celebrations were once held; where the flames crackled and fireworks whizzed on Guy Fawkes Night; where countless generations played cricket; the pitch may well be long gone, but the green probably remains. Little will happen on it, though: it is now no more than a pretty place to walk the dog.
</br></br>
The village hall will, apart from the church, be the only institution remaining in small villages. Where it was once busy, it will probably only host the occasional event - mostly private celebrations now, because much of the village population cares little for the community that lives there now. It will be run by the same half-dozen elderly people who keep everything going; without them, it may collapse into becoming even more rarely used.
</br></br>
The local school, built in Victorian times, is long closed due to being too small, and due to the replacement of families with wealthy, older people, having too few children as a village to sustain it. If it does remain it will be a 1970s ugly building which gathers in children from all the remaining villages and sticks out like a sore thumb in the old village. The small village shop it almost certainly gone, although it may survive if the school has. For most villages, especially the most rural, internet shopping and the big “superstore” in town has seen it close. It would probably have only ever been run in someone’s front room anyway, and all traces now are gone.
</br></br>
The summer fete may have hung on, a shadow of its former self, as people simply can’t be bothered anymore. It would probably have involved an agricultural show and the like, but alongside the death of the local farms, that tradition will have died too. It may well even have closed down altogether; in the smallest communities, it often has. Once making up the majority of the village, most rural villages will have seen smallscale farming abandoned as a necessity of cost, and landlords seeking higher residential or holiday incomes. If the farms do remain, they will be either large scale or run by elderly people who will be the last generation to do so, before they see the same fate as the rest.
</br></br>
<i>Many small villages were built to 18th or 19th century masterplans as “model” villages by the local “Big House”. Others will have been piecemeal over a period of five hundred years, in which case they will probably all have been built by the same builder using the same local materials out of necessity. Either way, they will once have had an overall sense of identity and shared aesthetic quality when viewed as a group. In the present day there will almost always be modern buildings which are built to the same carbon copy styles, without any reference to the old. There will probably be a small cul-de-sac or new street with a naff name like “Lemon Grove”. The village is larger than it ever was, yet the growth in population has only reduced the community spirit as there remains little to bring people together; swathes of people will want their local church to be there, but will never darken its doorways. They will be the first to complain when it closes and is converted badly into something else, but are the reason for its closure. Few village activities happen, as the population travels outwards for entertainment and shops; no sport is played on the old village green of cricket pitch. What was once a thriving community is now little more than a doritary for larger places elsewhere, with just the small signs of what once was to those who know where to look. A rotting pub sign, half hidden in a hedge; the fading lines in the grass where people once walked every day; any number of signs labelling this building The Old Rectory, that The Old Forge and another The Old Schoolroom; only memories of those few remaining men and women who grew up there of how things once were. If Merrie England ever existed, it is now undeniably dead.</i>
</br></br>
If this sounds rather depressing, it is because it is: a lot of small communities are at a tipping point between continuing in some form, or simply becoming a “dormitary village” for the local town. But I am not easily susceptible to misery. I am optimistic that everything happens for a reason and that other people care about what will happen in their communities too;  I am confident that hope will prevail.
</br></br>
I long to live in a small village where this world of the past has not died; somewhere I can live among the trees and the fields, keep animals and grow plants in my garden; somewhere that the community spirit has survived.
</br></br>
There are a very few pockets of the past left in England, despite everything. One such is the tiny village of Littlebredy in Dorset (pronounced “Littlebriddy”). It is home to just 85 people, in a scattering of houses on the Bride Valley. It lies on a small road that is little used; one could almost imagine the advent of cars had not happened. The village is owned in its entirety by the Williams family, who have run the small Bridehead Estate since 1797. Successive generations of Williams have kept the village going as it always has done, unfazed by the changes of modern life. The village still has all its farms, where elsewhere they are gone; tenants are chosen not for the highest bidder, but rather for those who are willing to support the parish church and village community; no new houses have been built in the parish, ensuring that it has kept a sense of rural tranquility. The village is a tiny pocket of that lost world of the past, where we were as close as we ever will be to the bliss of "Merrie England". And the careful stewardship of the village is rewarded by a community that survives intact where it has otherwise collapsed: the soul of the village remains in the monthly social club in the village hall; the higher church attendance than many tiny parishes; and the regular community celebrations, like the annual Duck Race down the stream at Bridehead.
</br></br>
It is my idea of paradise. To live in a rural village, where time has stood still - and is still ruled by the slow pace of agricultural life. The estate also includes an area called The Valley of the Stones, which is a nature reserve managed by Natural England on behalf of the Estate. To give you some idea of how lovely it is there, let me show you this picture of the village church at sunset from the Old Parsonage garden. 
</br></br>
<img src="https://github.com/LordGnomeMBE/essay/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-06-27%20at%2018-49-37%20Ben%20Pentreath%20(@benpentreath)%20%E2%80%A2%20Instagram%20photos%20and%20videos.png?raw=true" width="100%">
</br></br>
The entire estate is sadly now up for sale (<a href="https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/148255958">here's</a> a link). I always find it sad to see the severing of such a longstanding family connection - in this case, the seventh generation. But sadder still, I fear what will happen under a new owner. I have seen it happen before that the estate will be split, rents raised to maximise profit, the farms closed at the earliest opportunity to become holiday lets, and new cheap and ugly houses will be built, destroying the architectural harmony of the village. It would be dreadful to lose one of these few remaining places of calm and tranquil.
</br></br>
The “Big House”, which is actually fairly small now since it had a wing demolished many decades ago, is fascinating to me. It, alongside much of the village, was designed in the Gothic Revival  style by Benjamin Ferrey, a pupil of one of my favourite architects, Augustus Welby Pugin. The Gothic Revival is one of my favourite architectural periods, and I would dearly love to be able to study it first hand.
</br></br>
The purchase cost of the estate is high, but it would be an absolute money pit. I believe that through lots of hard work and labour on my part, I could keep it just about breaking even. I would be willing to live in poverty if I were able to save this patch of heaven from ruin, and I mean that in all sincerity. Saving this place means a great deal to me, and I severely doubt I would ever make money from it, despite holding assets of that size. I would never sell off any of the estate, keeping it as a community, seeking to continue in the spirit of the Williamses to keep it as a corner of old-fashioned paradise. If it were possible, I would seek to tie up the property so that my descendents can never sell it either.
</br></br>
But my plans to make Littlebredy my vision of paradise don’t just involve conserving what’s there. I have ideas to make the village even better. The village’s tenanted houses are an image of rural loveliness, a picture-postcard scene of stone and thatch, but Bridehead, the “Big House” has seen better days. The formal gardens are more-or-less lost; though they would never have been so structured as some places and always included swathes of parkland, it is little more than lawn all over, fraying at the edges. The old kitchen gardens, in the village itself, were lost to jungle until the efforts of a few local gardeners saved them. In the grounds, the old stables, a beautiful piece of functional Gothic Revival art, are entirely overgrown and almost certainly structurally far from brilliant. The attached farmyard sits empty, the barns slowly falling apart.
</br></br>
The house itself is in little better condition. The estate agents’ photos show a house with cracking plaster and peeling paint - there is undoubtedly a great deal of hidden damage. Quite likely most of this stems from unsuitable materials (using cement instead of the traditional lime causes severe damp problems).
</br></br>
I have always wanted to grow my own vegetables and keep animals; I have designed a way to convert the old stables into a new kitchen garden, as you can see below.
</br></br>
<img src="https://github.com/LordGnomeMBE/essay/blob/main/Image.png?raw=true" width="100%">
</br></br>
I know enough about conserving historic buildings from being a member of S.P.A.B. (Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings) and taking part in their working parties, and working on my father’s historic churches to do most, if not all of this work myself, so as to spend as little money as possible. I propose that I could do this over my gap year that is fast approaching. I would learn the aspects of farming that I don’t know already from my great uncles, whose farms I visit as regularly as I can.
</br></br>
I have further ideas for the improvement of the village. In keeping with the “picturesque” philosophy behind the original design, I would build a small parlour-pub. These sorts of pubs don’t really exist anymore, but would be perfect for somewhere as small as Littlebredy, working on irregular hours and the like. Here is a sketch of what that could look like:
</br></br>

<img src="https://github.com/LordGnomeMBE/essay/blob/main/littlebredy_pub_elevation.jpg?raw=true" width="100%">
</br></br>
Similarly, I would like to return to the days of having a resident vicar for a village of Littlebredy’s size, and so I would, when the Estate saved the funds, build a small cottage for a “house for duty” vicar. The old Parsonage is enormous, and already rented out, so couldn’t be used. Incidentally, the occupant of the Old Parsonage is one of my favourite modern architects, Ben Pentreath, who designs in the historic style as in the past. This cottage would be situated next to Littlebredy Green alongside the pub, so as to be at the centre of the community. The entire village would be preserved as Clive Aslet describes it in <i>Villages of Britain: the five hundred villages that made the countryside</i>:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Bridehead; it is a romantic name, fragrant with the memory of Brideshead Revisited. But the Bridehead in Dorset, to which the village of Littlebredy belongs, has nothing to do with Madresfield Court in Worcestershire or Castle Howard in Yorkhire, the country houses on which Evelyn Waugh based the architectural element of his book. Nor does it have anything to do with marriage. Both names, Bride and Bredy, derive from a Celtic word meaning ‘to boil’, evoking the bubble of the spring that rises here. Bridehead is a lake, whose water, having served as a mirror to the Regency mansion house of Bridehead (deplored by Pevsner, but in a glorious setting), spills out over an artificial waterfall into a little stream of sparkling clarity that trips its way past the row of thatched cottages that stand beneath the church. Littlebredy is one of the last privately owned estate villages in Dorset. As a Tory, Waugh would have pleased, Benjamin Disraeli even more so.</br></br>
	Littlebredy demonstrates an inescapable and, in this democratic age, unwelcome truth: the prettiest villages are often those owned by estates. The control exercised by family ownership is for the most part visually benign. It is difficult to think of many whose historical character has been traduced for ready money through inappropriate development. One would not dream of making a social case for the estate village: history is full of cases in which tenants have been treated appalling, and others where well-intentioned paternalism has been resented. But on the whole, owners of landed estates have seen it as in their interest to preserve and enhance the appearance of villages.</br></br>
	Parsimony kept some of them safe from redevelopment during the dangerous years of the twentieth century. Agriculture – the traditional source of estate income – was at a low ebb during the first half of it. After the Second World War, when rents were protected but landowners still had to pay for repairs, consultants advised that villages should be sold, and the money invested in farm machinery. Thirty years later this counsel did not look so wise; property prices had boomed, farm profits shrivelled. Landowners now had an incentive to look after their property assets.</br></br>
	Not all landed estates survive through the generations: like all other human endeavours, some fail, some are broken up by divorce, taxes, bad management and the end of primogeniture. But many estate-oening families want continuity. Believing – or at least hoping – that their heirs will still be in possession in a century’s time, they can take a longer view of investment than most individuals or businesses. They also have a personal interest; they want their surroundings to look well.</br></br>
	At the western end of Littlebredy, a lodge and gate piers stand on the road to the village: pass us, they seem to be saying, and you enter somewhere special. The impression is confirmed by the bus shelter on the edge of the village green, an octagonal oak-framed structure with a shingle roof, although the school bus is now the only one that calls. Inside, an oak tablet records that the shelter was given to the people of Littlebredy to commemorate Philip and Margaret William’s silver wedding anniversary in 1933. (Furniture maker turned banker Robert Williams – his bank eventually became Williams and Glyn’s – bought the estate in 1797 and his family have been here ever since.)</br></br>
	From this plateau, a lane takes you down past the church, one of the few in Dorset to have a spire. Between gaps in the trees you glimpse roofs (thatched eaves rising like eyebrows over diamond-paned bedroom casements) and walls (dappled stone): they belong to the cottages in the valley, built by the first Robert Williams. Walk a little further and a notice invites visitors to pass into the parkland beside the lake. It may be that Sir Philip Williams, seventh generation of his family to own Littlebredy, is there too.</br></br>
	Through the estate office, Sir Philip keeps the place going – not just the fabric of the village, although that is important (the walled garden had become impenetrable until some keen gardeners took it on), but the soul. Prospective tenants are chosen with care. Willingness to support the church is an asset. A Social Club holds monthly events in the thatched VIllage Hall (once the schoolroom), and cricket is still played in the hauntingly lovely setting depicted by David Inshaw in his painting of 1975, The Cricket Game. Alterations to dwellings have to be approved by the estate, as well as the planning authorities. Weekenders are generally discouraged. Littlebredy is a lovely village and a community. Sir Philip conducts and the orchestra that surrounds him plays in tune.</p>
I truly believe that it is my calling to save this beautiful place for the future. It would break my heart to see it splintered after having survived so long. I am hoping you might be able to spare a tiny percentage of your huge income to enable me to save this corner of England so that I can run it as a steward of both the natural world and the people, preserving a lost way of life before it is too late. It would make all my dreams come true, as I could live the life I have always dreamed of, and share tis idyllic place with everyone.
</br></br>
Thank you very much for considering my appeal. Please do contact me by any of the methods in my letter, although please note that I often don’t hear the ‘phone ring! In the likely event you get no immediate response, please leave me a voicemail. If you’d like to videocall, that is possible too. I would be willing to travel to see you in person, but I am afraid I can’t afford to. I have probably expressed my thoughts in a really clunky way, missed bits out, and repeated myself, but I hope you can see through to my vision.
</br></br>

ᴘᴏsᴛsᴄʀɪᴘᴛ:</br></br>
As I had just finished writing this, I became aware of another piece of important heritage urgently at risk of something horrid happening to it. The Church of England is, sadly, selling off as many of its historic churches as it can get away with. Not as many as the Church of Scotland, but that’s another matter. The church of St Michael Paternoster Royal in the City of London was established by the most famous of the Lord Mayors, Dick Whittington, in 1397, and it is where he is buried. It makes me very sad that such a prominent and important piece of London - and the UK’s - history is being flogged off to the highest bidder. It is a beautiful and important church; I believe that it should remain a church for the use of anyone who might seek a few moments’ peace in the City, not turned into more offices. It is a disgrace that they are even considering selling it. I am hesitant to ask for more favours, but if you could help me save it, too, I could use the rent from the small flats already attached to help pay for its upkeep, keeping the church open in perpetuity for the benefit of the public. Being in the City it is no doubt expensive - they won’t even tell you the price without applying first - but it is a treasure that simply cannot be allowed to be lost to some soulless corporation to turn into offices. <a href="https://m.search-prop.com/st-michael-paternoster-royal-college-hill-city-of-london">Here</a> is a link to the sales listing, should you be interested.
